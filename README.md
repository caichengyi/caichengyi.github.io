# A Minimalistic Personal Website Project
This is a personal academic website project with only one ```index.html``` file.

## Introduction
In contrast to the typical complexity of academic website projects, which often require multiple files and intricate setups, this project offers a streamlined solution. This repository provides a simple academic website built with a single HTML file. The design follows a minimalistic approach, ensuring ease of use for individuals with little to no experience in HTML. 

## Setup Instructions
- **Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository.**
Begin by forking or downloading this repository.

- **Step 2: Customize Content.**
Open the ```index.html``` file and edit the content to reflect your personal information. You may also need to replace the images in the ```assets``` folder with your own to personalize the site.

- **Step 3: Maintain File Name.**
Ensure that the ```index.html``` file retains its original name, as this is essential for proper site functionality. Once modifications are complete, you can proceed to publish your site.
